    "Q-4. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)? \n",

    "Total number of favorable outcomes: There are four perfect squares between 1 and 20, which is 1, 4, 9, and 16.\n",

    "Ans - The probability that the number drawn from a perfect square is 1/5 or 0.2, which can also be expressed as 20%.\n"
